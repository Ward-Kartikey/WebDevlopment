      <b>India (IND) vs Australia (AUS) 1st ODI Highlights:</b> Australia have
      taken a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series against India after chasing
      down India’s target of 131 in 21.1 overs in a rain-interrupted game in
      Perth’s Optus Stadium. Mitchell Marsh was Australia’s rock with the bat,
      staying unbeaten on 46 off 52 balls at the end.

        >Earlier in the first innings, India got off to a horrendous start after
        Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and new One-Day International skipper Shubman
        Gill fell inside PowerPlay with none of them going past the individual
        score of 10 runs after Australia invited India to bat first in the first
        ODI on Sunday.</big></p>

        <p><big>The focus was on Kohli and Rohit, who have already retired from T20Is
        and Tests. This was the first time since winning the Champions Trophy in
        March that these two stalwarts took the field for the Men in Blue.
        <br />
        <br />
        With both players keen to play the 2027 World Cup in South Africa, this
        series in Australia will be the stage for Rohit and Virat to prove their
        naysayers wrong. This will also be the first time in a while that Rohit
        will be in the team as a pure batter with the pressures of captaincy off
        him.

        That pressure of leadership, meanwhile, will fall on the young shoulders
        of Shubman Gill who will be marking his debut as India’s ODI skipper
        with this series. Like Tests, Gill replaced Rohit as the captain with
        the 25-year-old keen to prove his mettle Down Under.</big>
